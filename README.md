# Arris Password of the Day Generator for Android

-----------------------------------

**PLEASE READ THIS!**

1 - In the past few years, some internet service providers have been changing their modem configurations in ways that prevent this tool from working. If it doesn't work with your modem and your modem is in the supported modems list, I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it. Rating the app 1 star, complaining and being offensive is stupid and pointless.

2 - I am not Spanish or from Latin America. Please don't assume I can speak Spanish or that I have to reply to you in Spanish.

3 - A lot of people fail to read the instructions and then write 1-star reviews saying this app is "a piece of crap", "horrible", and even "disgusting" (how does that even apply to a mobile phone app?). This is a tool that I built in my spare time, with my resources, and am giving away for free. If you want full service or insult those who try to help others for free, go pay someone to listen to you.
